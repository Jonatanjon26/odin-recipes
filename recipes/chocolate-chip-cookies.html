    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>
    
    <strong><h2>Ingredients</h2></strong>
    <ul>
     <p><strong><li>Butter : </li></strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</p>    
     <p><strong><li>Eggs : </li></strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Vanilla : </li></strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Baking soda : </li></strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Water : </li></strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</p>
     <p><strong><li>salt : </li></strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Flour : </li></strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Chocolate chips : </li></strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</p>
     <p><strong><li>Nuts (optional) : </li></strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</p>
    </ul>
